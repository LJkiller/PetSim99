# Reconstructed PetSim99 Information

This repository utilizes the public PetSim99 API to display information about clans. It serves to display and share clan information based on my preferences.

This repository only serves to display and share clan information depending if people finds this repository.

## Introduction

PetSim99 is a popular online game where players can create and manage their own virtual pets. This program uses the PetSim99 API to fetch data about clans and presents it in a user-friendly format.

The information is created based on the information from PetSim99 API and is a reconstruction of existing dataNames. 

I have developed a program that allows users to save clan information into JSON files. 
The JSON files are then reconstructed with appropriate datanames, names and additional information provided by the PetSim99 API.

## Features

- Save clan information into JSON files.
- Reconstruct clan information based on data from the PetSim99 API.
- Additional clan information:
  - DiamondPosition

  - CommonParticipants
